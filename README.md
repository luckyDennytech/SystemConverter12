Tiny client-side PWA for converting numbers between bases and performing arithmetic on numbers provided in a selected base.  
Supports bases 2, 8, 10, 16 and fractional input. Single-page app — no build step.

Features
- Convert numbers between binary, octal, decimal and hex (with fractional parts).
- Perform arithmetic (add, sub, mul, div) on two numbers entered in the same base.
- PWA-ready: has `manifest.json` and a service worker (fixes required — see below).
- Small, dependency-free, client-only codebase (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS).
